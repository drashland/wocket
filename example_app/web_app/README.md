# Drash Sockets: Mini Chat App

## Getting Started

1. [Download deno](https://deno.land/).

2. Clone the repo and go into its directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/drashland/sockets.git
cd sockets
```

3. Open up a terminal and start the socket server.

```
deno --allow-net example_app/console_app/server.ts
Socket server started at 127.0.0.1:3000
```

4. Open up `index.html` twice to test two clients.

5. Start sending messages between both. Also, refresh the `index.html` files to simulate reconnecting to the chatroom.
