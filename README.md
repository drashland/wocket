**_Although Sockets has working code, it is still very much under development and unstable. APIs will change without notice. Sorry for any inconvenience!_**

## Getting Started

To get you started as quickly as possible with a simple client and server, check out the following example app:

* [Browser Console](./example_apps/browser_console)

We also have a more advanced example app:

* [Chat](./example_apps/chat)

All example apps in the `example_apps` directory have their own `README.md` file. The `README.md` files have all the instructions you need to get started.

## Integrating

Sockets is composed of two parts:

* A `SocketServer` class that is used to instantiate a socket server on the back-end

    ```typescript
    import { SocketServer } from "https://deno.land/x/sockets@master/mod.ts";
    ```

* A client library that loads on the front-end

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/drashland/sockets@master/client.js">
    ```

    ```html
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/drashland/sockets@master/client-module.js">
    ```
